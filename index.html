                <p>I am a very sporty person and my favorite hobby is football.
                    <br>
                    My dream was to be a
                    football player.
                    <br>
                <p>But you can say it's every child's dream, you grow up fast and realize that football is not
                    everything
                    in
                    life.
                    <br>
                    so I decided to learn other things and try to find the field that suits me best and do everything
                    100% so that I
                    succeed.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>I have tried for a long time to find a job that suits me and where I will be recognized for my true
                    worth.
                    I did a lot of odd jobs until I joined the army.
                    after the army, I tried to resume my studies, but I went in a bit blindly without even knowing if I
                    was going to like
                    it, I didn't like it so I stopped and decided to start something that really interests me.</p>
                <br>
                <p> Today I found my place in the world of digital marketing and I want to enrich my knowledge in the
                    world

                <br>
                <p>I live in a family with five brothers and sisters.
                    I am the second son.</p>
                <br>
                <p>my parents educated us well and instilled in us good values and the importance of support between
                    siblings. This is why
                    we are united to this day and we push each other to bring out the best in ourselves.</p>
                <br>
                <p>I have a very good relationship with my brothers and sisters. I learned a lot from my big brother. He
                    opened my way to
                    many things. I followed the same military path as him, and today I followed him again on this
                    developer internship and I
                    am delighted. I try to set an example for my little brothers and sisters and lead them in the right
                    path to follow.</p>
